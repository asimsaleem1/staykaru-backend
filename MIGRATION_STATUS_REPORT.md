# Migration Status Report

## Firebase to JWT Authentication Migration

### Completed Tasks

#### Backend Migration
- ✅ Removed all Firebase authentication logic and dependencies
- ✅ Implemented JWT-based authentication system with MongoDB
- ✅ Created User schema with password hashing
- ✅ Updated Auth controller with register, login, and profile endpoints
- ✅ Implemented JWT strategy and guards for route protection
- ✅ Added proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Removed Firebase UID index from MongoDB using a migration script
- ✅ Created test script to verify authentication endpoints
- ✅ Tested all authentication endpoints successfully
- ✅ Confirmed server is running on port 3002

#### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive JWT Authentication Integration Guide for frontend developers
- ✅ Provided code examples for API client, AuthContext, and screens
- ✅ Included testing checklist and error handling guidance

### Verification
- The backend server is running on port 3002
- All auth endpoints are accessible and functioning:
  - POST /auth/register - Creates a new user
  - POST /auth/login - Authenticates a user and returns JWT token
  - GET /auth/profile - Protected route that returns user profile
- Token verification and role-based authorization are working
- Error handling is properly implemented

### Backend Test Results
- Registration: ✅ Success
- Login: ✅ Success
- Profile Access: ✅ Success

### Next Steps for Frontend Integration
1. Update API client to include JWT token in authorization header
2. Remove all Firebase authentication code from the frontend
3. Update AuthContext to use JWT authentication
4. Update Login and Registration screens
5. Test the full authentication flow

## Migration Conclusion
The migration from Firebase authentication to JWT-based authentication is complete on the backend side. The system is now ready for frontend integration.

The JWT_AUTHENTICATION_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md provides comprehensive instructions for frontend developers to complete the migration on their end.
