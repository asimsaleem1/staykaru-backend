**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check MongoDB service status
sudo systemctl status mongod

# Restart MongoDB service
sudo systemctl restart mongod

# Check connection string in .env file
# Ensure network access for MongoDB Atlas
```

**Node.js Version Conflicts:**
```bash
# Use Node Version Manager (nvm)
nvm install 18.17.0
nvm use 18.17.0

# Verify Node.js version
node --version
npm --version
```

**React Native Build Errors:**
```bash
# Clean build cache
npx react-native clean

# Reset Metro cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# For Android issues
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# For iOS issues (macOS only)
cd ios && rm -rf build && pod install && cd ..
```

**Port Conflicts:**
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill process using port
kill -9 PID_NUMBER

# Use different port
PORT=3001 npm run start:dev
```

**Environment Variable Issues:**
```bash
# Verify .env file exists and is properly formatted
cat .env

# Check environment variables are loaded
node -e "console.log(process.env.MONGODB_URI)"

# Restart application after env changes
npm run start:dev
```

**Heroku Deployment Issues:**
```bash
# Check Heroku logs for errors
heroku logs --tail

# Verify buildpack
heroku buildpacks

# Set Node.js version in package.json
"engines": {
  "node": "18.17.0",
  "npm": "9.6.7"
}
```

**Memory and Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit
