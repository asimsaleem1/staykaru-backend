# Role-Based Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented role-based dashboards for landlords and food providers in the StayKaru backend. This implementation allows users with specific roles to:

1. **Landlords:**
   - View all their accommodations
   - Access a dashboard with summary statistics
   - View bookings for their accommodations
   - Access analytics for their properties

2. **Food Providers:**
   - View all their food services
   - Access a dashboard with summary statistics
   - Manage menu items (view, create, update, delete)
   - View orders for their food services
   - Access analytics for their businesses

## Implementation Details

### Landlord Dashboard
- Added methods to `AccommodationService`:
  - `findByLandlord`: Get all accommodations owned by a landlord
  - `getLandlordDashboard`: Get summary dashboard data
  - `getLandlordBookings`: Get all bookings for a landlord's accommodations
  - `getLandlordAnalytics`: Get analytics for a landlord's accommodations

- Added endpoints to `AccommodationController`:
  - `GET /accommodations/landlord/my-accommodations`
  - `GET /accommodations/landlord/dashboard`
  - `GET /accommodations/landlord/bookings`
  - `GET /accommodations/landlord/analytics`

- Updated `AccommodationModule` to include the `BookingSchema`

### Food Provider Dashboard
- Added methods to `FoodProviderService`:
  - `findByOwner`: Get all food providers owned by a user
  - `getMenuItems`: Get all menu items for a specific food provider
  - `createMenuItem`: Create a new menu item
  - `updateMenuItem`: Update an existing menu item
  - `deleteMenuItem`: Delete a menu item
  - `getProviderOrders`: Get all orders for a specific food provider
  - `getProviderDashboard`: Get summary dashboard data
  - `getProviderAnalytics`: Get analytics for a user's food providers

- Added endpoints to `FoodProviderController`:
  - `GET /food-providers/owner/my-providers`
  - `GET /food-providers/owner/dashboard`
  - `GET /food-providers/owner/menu-items/:providerId`
  - `POST /food-providers/owner/menu-items/:providerId`
  - `PUT /food-providers/owner/menu-items/:providerId/:itemId`
  - `DELETE /food-providers/owner/menu-items/:providerId/:itemId`
  - `GET /food-providers/owner/orders/:providerId`
  - `GET /food-providers/owner/analytics`

- Updated `FoodServiceModule` to include the `OrderSchema`

### Testing
- Created a PowerShell script `test-role-dashboards.ps1` to test all the new endpoints
- The script tests authentication, dashboard data retrieval, and CRUD operations for menu items

### Documentation
- Created a comprehensive guide `ROLE_BASED_DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for frontend developers
- The guide includes:
  - Available endpoints and their purposes
  - Suggested UI structure for each dashboard
  - Implementation guidelines for authentication and routing
  - UI/UX recommendations
  - Testing instructions

## Deployment
- Created deployment scripts:
  - `deploy-role-dashboards.sh` for Linux/macOS
  - `deploy-role-dashboards.ps1` for Windows

## Next Steps
1. Create test users with the appropriate roles
2. Conduct thorough testing with real data
3. Integrate with the frontend application
4. Monitor performance and make optimizations as needed
5. Consider adding more features based on user feedback
