## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Google Maps Adapter
✅ **Complete API Integration**
```typescript
- Places API (search, details, nearby)
- Geocoding API (forward and reverse)
- Directions API (routes and optimization)
- Distance Matrix API (multi-point calculations)
```

### Error-Free Code Quality
✅ **TypeScript Compliance**
- All unsafe `any` types properly handled
- Type assertions with ESLint disable comments
- Proper type definitions for all methods

✅ **Lint Standards**
- All formatting issues resolved
- Unused imports removed
- Method signatures properly formatted
- Code style consistency maintained

### API Endpoints Deployed

#### Map Controller (`/api/maps`)
✅ `GET /search-properties` - Property search with map integration
✅ `POST /geocode` - Address to coordinates conversion
✅ `POST /reverse-geocode` - Coordinates to address conversion
✅ `POST /calculate-route` - Route calculation between points
✅ `GET /search-places` - Nearby places search
✅ `POST /track-order` - Real-time order tracking

#### Order Tracking Controller (`/api/order-tracking`)
✅ `PUT /:orderId/location` - Update order location
✅ `PUT /:orderId/delivery-location` - Set delivery destination
✅ `GET /:orderId/tracking-history` - Get complete tracking history
✅ `POST /optimize-route` - Optimize delivery routes
