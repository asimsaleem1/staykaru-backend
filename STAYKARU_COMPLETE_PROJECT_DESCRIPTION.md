### üîß Frontend Features Implementation

#### **1. User Authentication System**
The authentication system is built using React Context API for global state management. When users log in, the system receives a JWT (JSON Web Token) from the backend server which is then stored in the browser's local storage. This token is automatically included in all subsequent API requests to verify the user's identity. The authentication context provides login, logout, and user state management functions throughout the entire application, ensuring secure access to protected features like booking accommodations and accessing user profiles.

#### **2. Interactive Map Integration**
The Google Maps integration is implemented using the React Google Maps API library, which provides interactive map functionality with custom markers for each accommodation. Users can view their current location through geolocation services, and accommodations are displayed as custom markers on the map. Each marker shows different icons based on the accommodation type (hotel, apartment, etc.). When users click on markers, they see detailed information about that accommodation in an info window. The map also includes clustering functionality to group nearby markers when zoomed out, improving performance and visual clarity when displaying many accommodations in the same area.

#### **3. Real-time Chat System**
The real-time communication system is powered by Socket.io, which establishes WebSocket connections between the frontend and backend. This enables instant messaging between users and accommodation hosts without page refreshes. The chat system maintains persistent connections, automatically handles reconnection if the connection drops, and stores message history. Users can send and receive messages in real-time, see typing indicators when someone is composing a message, and receive notifications for new messages even when they're browsing other parts of the application.

#### **4. Responsive Design Implementation**
The application follows a mobile-first design approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout management. The design adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers. The accommodation grid layout shows one column on mobile devices, two columns on tablets, and three columns on desktop screens. This ensures optimal viewing experience regardless of the device being used. All interactive elements are touch-friendly on mobile devices, and the navigation adapts to provide easy access to all features on smaller screens.

#### **5. Advanced Search & Filtering**
The search and filtering system allows users to find accommodations based on multiple criteria including city, price range, accommodation type, amenities, and minimum rating. The search state is managed efficiently using React hooks, and results are fetched dynamically from the backend API as users modify their search criteria. The system uses React Query for caching search results, which improves performance by avoiding unnecessary API calls when users navigate back to previous searches. Users can save their preferred search filters for quick access in future sessions.

### üîß Backend Architecture & Modules

#### **1. Modular Structure**
The backend follows NestJS modular architecture pattern, where each feature is organized into separate modules. Each module contains its own controllers (handling HTTP requests), services (business logic), and schemas (data models). This structure includes dedicated modules for authentication and authorization, user management, accommodation CRUD operations, food service management, booking system, order management, real-time chat functionality, payment processing, push notifications, usage analytics, geolocation services, and file management. This modular approach makes the codebase maintainable, testable, and scalable, allowing different team members to work on different modules simultaneously without conflicts.

#### **2. Database Schema Design**
The database uses MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for flexible document-based data storage. The Accommodation schema includes all essential property information such as title, description, address, city, and geographic location stored as GeoJSON Point coordinates for spatial queries. Each accommodation has pricing information, capacity details, type classification, amenities list, and image galleries. The schema includes embedded host information with verification status and contact details, as well as rating and review data. Geospatial indexes are created on the location field to enable fast proximity-based searches, allowing users to find accommodations near their desired location efficiently. The schema design supports both simple queries and complex aggregation operations for advanced features like recommendations and analytics.

#### **3. Authentication Implementation**
The authentication system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) strategy implemented with Passport.js. When users log in with valid credentials, the system generates a JWT token containing user information and role details. This token is digitally signed using a secret key stored in environment variables, ensuring its authenticity and preventing tampering. The JWT strategy validates incoming tokens on protected routes by extracting them from the Authorization header, verifying the signature, and populating the request with user information. Route guards are implemented to protect sensitive endpoints, automatically rejecting requests without valid tokens or insufficient permissions. The system supports role-based access control, allowing different levels of access for regular users, hosts, and administrators.

#### **4. Real-time Communication**
The real-time communication system is built using Socket.io WebSocket gateway that handles persistent connections between clients and the server. The gateway manages connection events, including when users connect and disconnect, and maintains a map of connected users for efficient message routing. When users send messages, the system processes them through the chat service, stores them in the database, and immediately broadcasts them to relevant recipients using room-based communication. This allows for private conversations between users and hosts, group chats, and real-time notifications. The system handles connection state management, automatic reconnection, and message delivery confirmation to ensure reliable communication even with unstable network connections.

## üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps Integration

### Implementation Details

#### **Frontend Map Integration**
The frontend map implementation creates an interactive Google Maps interface that displays accommodations as custom markers based on their geographic coordinates. The system automatically detects the user's current location using the browser's geolocation API and centers the map accordingly, with a fallback to Islamabad coordinates if location access is denied. Each accommodation is represented by a unique marker icon that varies based on the accommodation type - hotels use different icons than apartments or rooms. The map includes marker clustering functionality that groups nearby accommodations when zoomed out, improving performance and visual clarity when displaying hundreds of properties. Users can click on markers to view detailed accommodation information in popup windows, and the map integrates seamlessly with the search and filtering system to update displayed accommodations in real-time as users modify their search criteria.

#### **Backend Geospatial Queries**
The backend implements sophisticated geospatial search capabilities using MongoDB's built-in geospatial features. The location service provides functionality to find nearby accommodations within a specified radius using the dollar-near operator, which automatically calculates distances from a given point and returns results sorted by proximity. The system supports finding accommodations within specific geographical boundaries using bounding box queries, which is useful for map-based searches where users want to see all accommodations visible in their current map view. These geospatial queries are optimized with 2dsphere indexes, enabling fast search performance even with thousands of accommodations. The system can handle complex location-based searches combining proximity with other criteria like price range, accommodation type, and amenities, providing users with highly relevant and geographically convenient options.

## üå± Data Seeding System

### CSV Data Processing Implementation

#### **Accommodation Data Seeder**
The data seeding system processes CSV files containing accommodation data from multiple cities and transforms them into MongoDB-compatible documents. The seeder reads CSV files using streaming to handle large datasets efficiently without loading everything into memory at once. Each row of data undergoes validation and transformation, including coordinate verification, price conversion from USD to Pakistani Rupees, and data cleaning to remove invalid entries. The system generates additional realistic data such as random amenities from a predefined list, placeholder images, synthetic host information, and rating data to create a complete accommodation profile. The seeding process includes comprehensive error handling to skip invalid rows while continuing to process valid data, and generates detailed statistics showing the number of accommodations imported per city and by accommodation type.

#### **Data Validation & Transformation**
The data processing pipeline includes robust validation and transformation functions to ensure data quality and consistency. The system implements safe number conversion that handles various input formats, removes non-numeric characters, and provides sensible defaults for missing or invalid values. For accommodation type determination, the system analyzes both the room type and property name to intelligently categorize accommodations into hotels, apartments, houses, rooms, studios, or other types. The amenities generation creates realistic feature lists by randomly selecting from a comprehensive set of common accommodation amenities, ensuring each property has between three to ten amenities. Image generation provides placeholder URLs for property photos, and the system creates synthetic but realistic host profiles with contact information, join dates, and verification status to populate the database with complete, testable data.

## üéØ Recommendation System

### Intelligent Matching Algorithm

#### **Multi-Factor Recommendation Engine**
The recommendation system implements a sophisticated scoring algorithm that combines multiple factors to generate personalized accommodation suggestions. The system analyzes user preferences, historical behavior, and accommodation characteristics to calculate relevance scores. Location preference accounts for forty percent of the total score, using the Haversine formula to calculate distances between user preferences and accommodation locations, with closer properties receiving higher scores. Price matching contributes twenty-five percent, comparing accommodation prices against user budget ranges and preferences derived from past bookings. Amenities matching makes up twenty percent of the score, calculating the overlap between user-preferred amenities and accommodation features. Historical behavior analysis contributes ten percent, learning from user's past viewing and booking patterns to understand implicit preferences. Finally, general popularity and rating account for five percent, ensuring that highly-rated and frequently booked accommodations receive appropriate consideration in recommendations.

#### **Advanced Recommendation Algorithms**
The system implements multiple recommendation strategies working together to provide comprehensive suggestions. Content-based filtering analyzes accommodation characteristics to find similar properties based on price ranges, accommodation types, and amenity overlap, using mathematical similarity calculations to score relationships between properties. Collaborative filtering identifies users with similar booking patterns and suggests accommodations that like-minded users have chosen, creating a community-driven recommendation experience. The system also maintains a trending algorithm that tracks recent booking activity, user ratings, and review counts to surface popular accommodations that are currently in demand. All recommendations include human-readable explanations detailing why specific accommodations were suggested, such as location preferences, budget alignment, amenity matches, or high ratings, helping users understand and trust the recommendation logic.
