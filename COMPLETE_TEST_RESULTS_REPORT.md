## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Successfully Deployed to Heroku**  
‚úÖ **Database Connected**  
‚úÖ **Authentication Working**  
‚úÖ **Admin Features Production-Ready**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **User Features Need Development**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Landlord Features Need Implementation**

## Overall Assessment

The StayKaru backend shows **strong foundation with excellent admin controls** but needs significant development work for user-facing features. The admin system is production-ready and highly functional, while user and landlord features require additional implementation to reach production readiness.

**Current State:** Ready for admin use, needs development for full user functionality.  
**Recommended Action:** Continue development on user features while maintaining the excellent admin control system.
